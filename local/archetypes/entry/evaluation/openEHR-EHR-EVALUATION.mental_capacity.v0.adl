This archetype is intended to capture information about the mental capacity status of an individual, which is typically assessed in relation to a specific decision or plan that needs to be made about their medical care or treatment at a particular time. If specific details about the mental capacity assessments are required, additional archetypes can be nested within the 'Assessment details' SLOT.">
